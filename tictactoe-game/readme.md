# Design a Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Requirements

-  The game is played on a 3 * 3 grid. One player uses ‘X’ another player uses ‘O’ and each player takes turns making their moves.
- The game is won by the player placing his or her symbol in a row, column, or diagonal. The first player to get three symbols in a row wins the game. When the player reaches this, the game ends immediately.
- If all the grid cells are filled and no player has three symbols in a row, the game will be a tie or a draw.
- A player cannot place his or her symbol on a tile occupied by an opponent’s symbol or their own symbol. The move must be made to an empty cell.
